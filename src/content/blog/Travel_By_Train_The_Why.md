The reason why for thinking about the game, planning the game and now developing the game is four fold. 

First, we need more trains to get away from cars.

Second, we need to understand the pros and cons of train travel. 

Third, there is so much history in Colorado that directly result from trains, its important to know how we got here in the modern era. 

Fourth, I am wanting to learn new skills and share what we learn along the way.
