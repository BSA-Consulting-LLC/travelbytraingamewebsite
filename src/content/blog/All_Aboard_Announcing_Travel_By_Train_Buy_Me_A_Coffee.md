Hello everyone, and welcome! Were incredibly excited to be launching our [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/travelbytraingame) page as a option to give besides our Patreon page! 

## Help the Crew: Buy us a coffee!
Currently, every aspect of Travel By Train's development – from research and design to coding and asset creation – is being funded entirely by self funding. This is a massive undertaking, and to truly realize the full potential of this game and expand its reach, we need your support.

By becoming a Coffee member, you'll be directly contributing to the development of Travel By Train and helping us bring this unique vision to life. Your contributions will help with:

- Software development
- Art assets and music
- Historical research
- And ultimately, faster progress and a higher quality game!

If you want to go above and beyond, look into supporting the project via a [Patreon membership](https://www.patreon.com/c/TravelByTrainGame)! You will gain access to exclusive content, behind-the-scenes updates, early peeks at new features, and potentially even opportunities to influence the game's development. We're building a community around this project, and I'd love for you to be a part of it.

Your support, no matter the size, makes a monumental difference. Together, we can build a truly special game that not only entertains but also educates and inspires a renewed appreciation for the world of rail.

Thank you for being here at the start of this exciting journey! Let's get Travel By Train on the tracks!
