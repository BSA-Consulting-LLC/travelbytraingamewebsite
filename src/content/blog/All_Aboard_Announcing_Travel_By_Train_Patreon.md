Hello everyone, and welcome! Were incredibly excited to be launching the [Patreon page](https://patreon.com/TravelByTrainGame)! This isn't just any game; it's a passion project aimed at bringing the beauty, history, and vital importance of passenger rail to life, starting right here in the stunning state of Colorado.

## What is Travel By Train?
Imagine exploring Colorado's breathtaking landscapes from the comfort of a train, experiencing its rich history and vibrant culture, all while embarking on engaging challenges and discoveries. That's the essence of Travel By Train. This game will immerse you in the world of Colorado's railways, allowing you to:

Journey through iconic routes: From the majestic Rocky Mountains to historic mining towns, you'll traverse virtual tracks inspired by real Colorado lines.

Discover untold stories: Unearth fascinating historical facts about the railroads that shaped this region, and learn about the diverse communities and cultures they connected.

Engage with environmental themes: See firsthand how passenger rail offers a sustainable and environmentally conscious way to travel, highlighting its benefits for our planet.

## Why Create This Game?
For too long, passenger rail in regions like Colorado has been overlooked. Yet, it offers so much more than just transportation. It's a journey through the history of the state, a connection to local communities, and a crucial piece of the puzzle for a sustainable future.

My motivation for creating Travel By Train is deeply personal. I believe in the power of games to educate, inspire, and spark curiosity. I want to:

Raise awareness for passenger rail: By showcasing the incredible potential and inherent benefits of train travel – from reducing traffic congestion and saving money, to connecting communities and supporting economic growth – I hope to inspire more people to advocate for and utilize these vital services.

Celebrate Colorado's rich heritage: The railroads are woven into the fabric of Colorado's history. From the gold rush era to the development of our mountain towns, trains played a pivotal role. This game is a way to honor that legacy and share it with a new generation.

Highlight the environmental advantages: In an era of increasing climate concerns, passenger rail stands out as a significantly more eco-friendly alternative to individual car travel or even flying. Travel By Train will subtly, yet powerfully, illustrate this impact.

Look to the future, globally: While we're starting in Colorado, my long-term vision for Travel By Train is to expand our virtual rail network to other incredible regions around the world. Imagine exploring the Trans-Siberian Railway, the Scottish Highlands by train, or the stunning routes of Japan – all within the game! This project is just the beginning of a much larger journey to explore global railway cultures.
